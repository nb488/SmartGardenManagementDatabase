# Project Description

Our project is a smart-garden monitoring system that allows for a garden to be broken up 
into sections, each of which may be allocated resources, plants, and tools as required. Each 
section has a monitoring system which tracks various environmental endpoints and resource 
usage, as well as maintains a maintenance log. Every garden has an owner and others may be 
granted access to it.

# Additional Instruction
